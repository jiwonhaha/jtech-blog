Hello! I'm interested in computer vision, language models, and machine learning. Through this blog, Iâ€™ll be focusing especially on research papers related to 3D computer vision, such as scene representation, geometry understanding, and neural rendering. I hope to use this space to break down complex ideas, share insights, and deepen my understanding while engaging with the latest developments in the field.
